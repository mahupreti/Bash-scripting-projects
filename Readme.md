### Automatic wifi scheduler
This project is simple automatic wifi on/off. This project was built to help myself stay away from internet and take some rest. I have used basic commands to test the internet connection and run the up and down of the wireless network interface of my laptop.


Cronjob was used for automatic time scheduling.
